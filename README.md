# 🚀 HR Analytics & Attrition Insights Project

# Project Overview -
This project is focused on understanding employee trends, workforce behaviour, and attrition patterns using an HR dataset.
I completed the full analysis using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.
The main goal was to clean the data, explore key patterns, and build a clear dashboard that can help HR teams make decisions.

# Tools & Technologies -
1. Excel – data cleaning & quick checks
2. SQL (MySQL) – data manipulation & analytical queries
3. Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) – Data Cleaning, EDA & visual insights
4. Power BI – interactive dashboard

## Objectives -
1. Clean and prepare employee data
2. Analyse factors that impact employee attrition
3. Build visual insights using Python
4. Create an HR dashboard with KPIs
5. Summarise key findings clearly

# Insights -
1. Highest attrition found in Sales and Support job roles.
2. Employees aged 25–32 leave more often.
3. Low performance rating & high leave count show stronger attrition patterns.
4. Early-experience employees (1–3 years) contribute to majority exits.
